The event which was organized by the department of social welfare of the Dormaa  West District Assembly was graced by the District Chief Executive, Hon. Francis kwadwo Oppong, the district Coordinating Director, Mr Idrisu mahama  and some heads of department at the assembly.

At the event, items which included  refrigerators, industrial sewing machines, provisions,  hair driers, Fufu pounding machines, knapsack sprayers, motorised sprayers, cheques etc were given out to persons with disabilities in the district.

In an introductory address by the head of social welfare department at the Dormaa West District Assembly, Mr. Eric Okrah  reiterated on the government’s decision to improve the living standards of the persons with disability in the country. 

Further in his address, he said the motive for the event was a conscious effort to see to it that every person with disability in the district lives to achieve their full potential. 

The District Chief Executive, Hon. Francis Kwadwo Oppong in his speech outlined the government’s intentions to develop the Dormaa West District. He touched on the planting for food and jobs, one district one factory which are all initiatives by the government to improve the standards of living of the Ghanaian citizenry, and massive road construction throughout the country which the district is also benefiting from.
Addressing issues on persons with disabilities, he said the government has increased the amount to be given to the disabled persons from 3% to 5% in the district assembly’s common fund.

 He also touched on the government’s intention to involve persons with disabilities in its governance. 

He cautioned the beneficiaries against selling of their items for physical cash.

 The Hon. DCE closing his speech encouraged persons with disabilities to be entrepreneurial in their day to day activities in order to keep up with the pace of development in the district and in the country as a whole.
     
Mr. Augustine Atoa Gyabaa, the  chairman of the District's PWDs thanked the president, Nana Addo Danquah Akuffo Addo and the District Chief Executive for their immense support to persons with disabilities.

The District Chief Executive for Dormaa West , Hon.Francis  Kwadwo Oppong , today , March 6, 2022 , on behalf of the President of the republic of Ghana ,
 Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo -Addo observed the 65th  independence day celebration at Nkrankwanta , the capital of Dormaa West District. 

In attendance were Nana 
Agyei Akyea Akombi II , the chief of Nkrankwanta and his elders , the Former MP for Dormaa West , Hon. Ali Maiga Halidu , Assembly members ,  Heads of Security
 agencies , Heads of Departments , Political parties reps , the clergy, the member of Parliament and the Muslim community . 

In delivering his speech , on the theme 
" Working together , bouncing back Better" , Hon. Francis Kwadwo Oppong charged the people to unite patriotically and  contribute their quota in  diverse ways in 
order to timely revamp the economy that was tempered by the COVID-19 pandemic , for it took the social , political and the economic struggle of "The big six " 
and some ex-service men to redeem Ghana from the  colonial suppression .

He prompted the people that , one of the measures that can bring Ghana's economy back 
on track in this hard times is the honest fulfillment of our tax obligations as citizens and clear example of the Electronic Transaction Levy ( E- Levy ) 
intended to be introduced by the government . 
The DCE therefore pleaded with the people to accept the passage of the tax for a better and a grounded nation building .

 
He entreated the people to utilize the afforestation and the Green Ghana policies , formulated and implemented by the Nana Addo's government .

He stated categorically that 
, the laws frown  at illegal Lumbering and logging, has caused Ghana a lot because deserted lands pave ways for heavy wind storms , prevent periodic rains and depletes the
 ozone layer . 

He finally sympathized and comforted  the  victimized schools and homes of the Thursday's rain storm at Nkrankwanta and assured them of government’s 
intervention.

He also met with the Dormaa West Rice Farmers Association where he officially inaugurated the association and charged them with the responsibility of farming and providing enough raw material to feed the factory.
The minister assured them of the government's support, being it Extension services, seed, fertilizer, herbicides, and machinery. 

Speaking on behalf of the Nkrankwanta Rice Processing Company, the secretary and board member, Dr. Aziz Khalid

Yesterday, Wednesday, 15th June, 2022, the District Chief Executive for Dormaa West District, Hon. Francis Kwadwo Oppong honoured an invitation to attend a meeting organised by the Dormas West District Cocoa Health Extension Division (CHED) at the methodist Church,  Nkrankwanta. 

Speaking at the meeting, Hon. Francis Kwadwo Oppong reiterated government’s plan to support farmers to improve on their farm products. He said cocoa farmers should embrace the government’s Cocoa rehabilitation programme. He said the rehabilitation programme will help farmers to regain their lost cocoa farms.

The DCE cautioned farmers, Cocoa mass sprayers and the gang leaders against selling of farm inputs which have been subsidised by the government. He urged the farmers to always form associations and or cooperatives to help CHED distribute farm inputs to them equitably. He said his office is open to all and sundry so farmers and CHED workers could pass by anytime the need arises.

Mr. David Afriyie Gyebi, District Director (CHED) thanked Hon. Francis Kwadwo Oppong for honouring their invitation.
