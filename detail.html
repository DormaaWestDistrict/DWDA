The District Chief Executive for Dormaa West , Hon.Francis  Kwadwo Oppong , today , March 6, 2022 , on behalf of the President of the republic of Ghana ,
 Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo -Addo observed the 65th  independence day celebration at Nkrankwanta , the capital of Dormaa West District. 

In attendance were Nana 
Agyei Akyea Akombi II , the chief of Nkrankwanta and his elders , the Former MP for Dormaa West , Hon. Ali Maiga Halidu , Assembly members ,  Heads of Security
 agencies , Heads of Departments , Political parties reps , the clergy, the member of Parliament and the Muslim community . 

In delivering his speech , on the theme 
" Working together , bouncing back Better" , Hon. Francis Kwadwo Oppong charged the people to unite patriotically and  contribute their quota in  diverse ways in 
order to timely revamp the economy that was tempered by the COVID-19 pandemic , for it took the social , political and the economic struggle of "The big six " 
and some ex-service men to redeem Ghana from the  colonial suppression .

He prompted the people that , one of the measures that can bring Ghana's economy back 
on track in this hard times is the honest fulfillment of our tax obligations as citizens and clear example of the Electronic Transaction Levy ( E- Levy ) 
intended to be introduced by the government . 
The DCE therefore pleaded with the people to accept the passage of the tax for a better and a grounded nation building .

 
He entreated the people to utilize the afforestation and the Green Ghana policies , formulated and implemented by the Nana Addo's government .

He stated categorically that 
, the laws frown  at illegal Lumbering and logging, has caused Ghana a lot because deserted lands pave ways for heavy wind storms , prevent periodic rains and depletes the
 ozone layer . 

He finally sympathized and comforted  the  victimized schools and homes of the Thursday's rain storm at Nkrankwanta and assured them of government’s 
intervention.

Hon. Presiding member
Hon. Member of Parliament
Hon. Assembly Members
Heads of Security Agencies
Departmental Heads 
Nananom
Media 
Distinguished Ladies and gentlemen <br>

I am extremely happy to present to you my sessional Address at this General Assembly meeting. Let me begin by welcoming you all to this very important meeting. 
The Government has successfully implemented 
the Electronic Transfer Act (E-Levy). 
I therefore entreat each and every one to give their maximum
 cooperation for its success. Hon. Members, this address will 
 briefly discuss, General Administration, Education, Works, Security, Health and others.<br><br>


GENERAL ADMINISTRATION<br><br>
Hon. Presiding member, I wish to indicate that the Dormaa west District Assembly continues to put in measures to ensures that the Assembly achieves its aims and objectives. 
I wish to commend the staff, Assembly members and all stakeholders for your roles in the Assembly in ensuring that we meet our collective goal of bringing development to the District.

I am happy to inform you that, the Minister for Local Government, Decentralization and Rural Development handed over this comfortable edifice( District Assembly Block)for the efficiency and productiveness of the Assembly. Furniture and other equipment were also provided to enable us function fully and effectively.

 All these I will say are the result of good policies of the government. So far, apart from the Agric Department, all departments are accommodated here.<br><br>

HUMAN RESOURCE<br><br>
There has been improvement in Human Resource capacity in the district where nine (9)
 officers have been posted in addition to the available staff at the District Assembly.
 Measures have been put in place to ensure punctuality and regular staff 
 attendance to work to stop the complaints by citizens about the poor attitude towards work.<br><br>

HEALTH<br><br>
Hon.Presiding member, there were series of Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the district to sensitize the people to take the vaccine.
 A total of 21,850 took the first dose, eleven thousand, 11,331 have taken the second dose whiles 2,267 have taken the booster dose making a total of 35,448 vaccines given to individuals in the district. 
Distribution of folic acid to girls in the district is also ongoing. 
There has been vaccination against schistosomiaisis for children in the age range of 5-15 years in the communities where over 90% of children within the specified age group have been reached. 

The assembly also supported the health directorate to conduct an HIV “know your status” campaign in March this year.
A nutrition friendly initiative dubbed “fruit day” was conducted in three schools, Krakrom Methodist, Nkrankwanta Islamic and Diabaa D/A.<br><br>

STATISTICS<br><br>
The 2021 population and housing census revealed that, the District is made of a total population of 47,913 comprising 25,522 males and 22,391 females. <br><br>


WORKS<br><br>
Hon. Members, in the area of works, several works ranging from roads to infrastructure are on-going. As you can see the Diabaa to Kraakrom road, Diabaa to Atesikrom through Yaakrom road, Nyamebekyere Junction to Nkwantaso through Kwakuanya road, Kwakuanya to Kwadwomokrom through Asuontam road all with culverts and drains are under construction just to mention but a few. 

2km Nkrankwanta town road from District Assembly through to the DCE residence has been awarded by Regional Highways with drains.
 The District fire station office is completed and handed over to the Assembly for occupancy by the Fire service. 

The District court complex and Judges Bungalow are all at various stages of construction. 

1 No. CHPS compound has been completed at Aprakukrom .<br><br>

WATER AND SATINATION<br><br>
Hon. PM, I am happy to inform the house that, 1 No. Borehole is under construction at Yaakrom and several others are to be drilled at various places in the district.<br><br>


SECURITY<br><br>
Hon. Presiding member, I must say that, generally, the security situation in the district is calm. As you can see businesses are moving on well and citizens are enjoying maximum peace and this I will say is earned through the proactive security policy of the government through the implementation of DISEC.
Hon. PM, as you are aware, we are not in normal times given the recent occurrences of terrorist attacks in other parts of Africa, Ghana is not exceptional to stay aloof. In a move to prevent this in Ghana, Government has embarked on the “See Something, Say Something” campaign which we must all endorse and support the government and the security agencies to achieve this goal. So the message goes that, “See Something, Say something”.
I will urge all of us to help in ensuring that the peace we enjoy is protected.<br><br>

EDUCATION<br><br>
Hon. Members, as part of government's policy to make education accessible to all at all levels, the Assembly has initiated the construction of 1No. KG block at Yaakrom, 1No. 3 Unit Classroom block at Asuontam and construction of Examination printing centre at Nkrankwanta all with DPAT and IGF respectively. Also girls from the District were trained in ICT, taken to Dormaa and Sunyani for competitions, after which the District Assembly awarded them with seven (7) laptops. A reading competition is also being organized for pupils at the lower primary level to
 increase their reading abilities which is slated to come off 7th July, 2022.<br><br>

AGRICULTURE <br><br>
Hon. Members, through the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Rural Enterprise Project, a 200KVA transformer was delivered for
 installation at the 1D1F to put it to work so as to achieve its intended
 purpose for the government policy on reducing post-harvest losses and increasing job creation. 

The Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Akoto Osei visited the District on Tuesday, 14th June, 2022 to inspect the Rice Milling Factory (CUF) at Nkrankwanta and inaugurated the Rice Farmers Association .
The assembly has procured five thousand (5000) palm seedlings to be distributed to farmers in the District.<br><br>

NADMO<br><br>
As we are aware, the district was hit by a rsinstorm which destroyed properties valued thousands of Ghana cedis. To this, the Assembly in collaboration with Nananom, the Local Council of churches and other relevant stakeholders have taken steps to assist in the provision of the destroyed properties. 
The SHS and the D/A blocks have been reroofed to bring academic work to normalcy.<br><br>

REVENUE MOBILIZATION AND FINANCE<br><br>
Hon. Presiding Member, you will agree with me that the Assembly’s developmental agenda cannot be achieved without sufficient funds. We must be mindful of the huge expenditures as against the Assembly’s scarce resources. 
This notwithstanding, the Assembly has strived in its efforts to improve revenue performance. However, cashew dealers within the 	District have been directed to register with the assembly and defaulters will be charged Gh200.00.  <br><br>

INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATION<br><br>
The District observed  the Independence Day Celebration here in Nkrankwanta at the Islamic Primary School. Deserving schools that performed extraordinarily during the march-past were awarded.<br><br>

SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY<br><br>
Hon. Presiding Member, in order to bridge the gap between the abled body persons and the less privileged in society, on 11thFebraury, 2022, 28 persons with disability in the district were given fridges, ice chest, sowing machines, hair dryers, fufu pounding machines, container stores as well as medical and educational support. 
I am happy to inform the house that, new items are ready to be distributed to 20 more people tomorrow, 30th June, 2022.<br><br>

STREET NAMING AND PROPERTY ADDRESS SYSTEM<br>
A drone was flown to capture Nkrankwanta to Ahenfiekrom and Yaakrom for satellite image for street naming and property address system which will be extended to all the communities in the District. Also a local plan has been drawn for Nyameama, Brofoyedu, Diabaa, Yaakrom with preparations ongoing to complete local plans for other communities.<br><br>

INTERNATIONAL BORDERS<br><br>
Hon. Members, not quite long ago,His Excellency the President of the Republic of Ghana, Nana Addo Danquah Akufo -Addo directed that all borders should be reopened.
 I visited all the boarders in the district both approved and unapproved with members of DISEC to gain first-hand information about their operation since the opening and realized everything was smooth. So our boarders are safe.
<br><br>
CONCLUSION<br><br>
Hon. Presiding Member, we have come a long way in the development of our District. I must admit that it has been a challenging one. However, when I look around and see the competence displayed by you Hon. Members, Traditional Council, Technocrats of the Assembly and the commitment of the General public, I am convinced that we can achieve a lot for our District. I wish us all a successful deliberation.
God Bless Dormaa West
God Bless Ghana
Thank you.
